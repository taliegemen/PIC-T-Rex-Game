Proteus file is created with Proteus 8.6 SP2.
C file is created with MikroC for PIC.
To edit the code, you can download MikroC folder (ProjectV2) and work from there directly with my settings.
All of the game frames are drawn by me with gimp so, feel free to use and change them as much as u want.
Please let me know if you want to contribute to this project.
